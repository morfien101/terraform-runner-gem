# terraform-runner-gem

## This repo is unmaintained. It was developed for an old version of terraform which didn't have these features.

Consider using naked Terraform or (Gruntwork - Terragrunt)[https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt] if you still have issues with Terraform.

## Original README
